### Summary
The College Resource Hub is a comprehensive, database-driven solution designed to streamline the process of locating academic and career resources for college students. By consolidating scattered resources into a centralized system, the platform ensures that students can easily and efficiently access the tools and information necessary for their academic success, career development, and personal growth. This project addresses the inefficiencies of existing systems, where students must navigate multiple platforms (e.g., Instagram, Outlook, websites, etc.) to find opportunities such as internships, mentorships, research positions, career fairs, and learning support programs.

One of the key strengths of this project lies in its ability to customize resource recommendations based on each student's unique background, interests, and goals. By creating a robust relational database structure and an intuitive UX/UI for navigating the platform, the system collects and organizes essential student data—such as academic year, major, personal interests, and professional aspirations—and uses this information to deliver personalized suggestions. This tailored approach eliminates the frustration of filtering through irrelevant options, ensuring that students receive opportunities that align closely with their needs.

### Introduction
College students rely on multiple, disconnected channels to explore academic and career opportunities. While these opportunities are essential for their professional and personal growth, the fragmented nature of these resources creates a highly inefficient and time-consuming process. For example, students may need to browse social media for event updates, check email for internship announcements, and navigate department-specific websites for research positions or scholarships. Students must spend considerable time searching across these various platforms and communication channels to find relevant information. This lack of a streamlined system not only reduces productivity but also causes many students to miss deadlines, overlook key opportunities, or struggle to identify resources that align with their goals and interests.

These challenges are particularly pronounced for first-generation students and other marginalized groups, who often encounter additional obstacles such as limited professional networks, a lack of familiarity with campus systems, or difficulty navigating available support services. The fragmented nature of information further deepens these inequities, placing these students at a significant disadvantage compared to their peers. To address these issues, this project introduces a centralized database designed to integrate academic and career resources into a single, user-friendly platform. The system offers personalized resource recommendations tailored to each user's academic background, interests, and career goals, ensuring the relevance and practicality of the opportunities presented. Moreover, intuitive navigation features enable users to efficiently explore resources, stay on top of deadlines, and monitor their progress.
