## GrabNGrocery - a convenient grocery app 
Jae Ji, FA2024

In this paper, I will present a project called GrabNGrocery, a location-based app designed to improve grocery shopping for college students, young adults, and underprivileged communities. This app will emphasize three key development principles: user-centered design, community-focused innovation, and sustainable workflow integration.


### Introduction/Headings    

[Comment_1]: <In today’s fast-paced world, grocery shopping is often a time-consuming and stressful task, particularly for college students, young adults, and vulnerable populations. Balancing tight budgets, busy schedules, and trying to make healthier, cost-effective choices creates a challenging everyday routine for these groups. As a college student myself, I’ve experienced firsthand the struggles of managing grocery expenses, finding affordable ingredients, and navigating the challenges of cooking all on a tight schedule. These personal challenges inspired me to develop a solution that not only addresses my own needs but also supports others in similar situations, particularly underprivileged communities.
My project aims to create a revolutionary grocery shopping app that combines personalization, price transparency, and location-based convenience. By bridging the information gap between shoppers and local grocery stores, this app can empower users to efficiently find the best deals on ingredients and products they need. It also encourages informed decision-making, reduces food waste, and supports local businesses. Whether it’s a student trying to manage their grocery expenses, a young adult learning to cook for the first time, or someone on a limited income seeking deals, this app simplifies the process, making grocery shopping more accessible and efficient for all.>
