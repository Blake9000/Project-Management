# Hello, I'm Pavithra Ramakrishnan

I'm a senior at the **iSchool** and **FAA** at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). Originally from California, I have a passion for design, technology, and user experience, and I'm excited to contribute to this project management class. 

I’ve always loved both Siamese and orange tabby cats. One day, I’d love to have these two cats in my life, enjoying their distinct personalities. Here's an image that inspires me:
